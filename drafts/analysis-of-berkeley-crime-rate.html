                </h2>

                <p>During the first few months of the Fall 2015 semester, there have been a sudden
increase of public service announcements (PSAs) in regards to the crimes
happening around the UC Berkeley campus. Most of the PSAs took place in <em>Free &amp;
For Sale</em> Facebook group for UC Berkeley students, and many were reports of actual encounters from the victims.</p>
<p>Many members of the community began to question whether the crime rates have actually gone up from the previous years, and eventually, many expressed their concern of safety. In this article, I analyze the "Crime incidents" dataset provided by City of Berkeley through Open Data to shed some light on the situation to ease the confusion. </p>
<p>First, I looked at the frequencies of crimes happening in Berkeley.
Unfortunately, the dataset only ranges for the past five months, so I could not
conclude whether Berkeley in Fall 2015 is more dangerous than Berkeley in
Fall 2014. I have sent out an email to City of Berkeley for more data, but I
have not heard back yet. If I finally do get data that ranges over a year, I will make sure to update. </p>
<h1>include it in the behind-the-scene article (did not include due to its obviousness and lack of data range)</h1>
<h1><img alt="Line chart of plotting crime vs. month" src="/images/crime_per_month.png" /></h1>
<p>While I did not have enough data to figure out the year-long trend in crime
rates, I wanted to figure out the most dangerous hours of the day since that is
a piece of information that students can actively use by choosing less dangerous
hours to venture out.</p>
<p><img alt="Line chart of plotting crim vs. hour" src="/images/crime_per_hour.png" /></p>
<p>Counter-intuitively, the lowest number of crimes happen from 1AM to 7AM, which
is the hours we typically regard as the dangerous hours since it's dark out.
However, note that this graph plots absolute frequencies, so the difference of
crime frequencies could be just the difference of population roaming outside at
those specific hours, drastically changing the potential number of victims and perpetrators.</p>
<p>To reflect the invidual interest of a student, we need to examine the ratio
between the number of crimes and the number of people outside per hour. The ratio tells us a very useful information </p>
<p>Students often face very limited set of choices in preventing a crime other than the choice of when to go out. </p>
<p>It does not tell a useful information since students can't act upon it.</p>

<p>TRASH
Because the purpose of the article is to inform students to take an active, prevenatative actions, many students </p>
<p>intention of the article: what can you do to be safer?
information that you cannot use is useless. In other words, focus on information that can be acted upon</p>
<p>ASSUMPTION:
1. you are a single student (no family offense)
2. interested in what you can do; offenses beyond your control ()</p>
<p>Focus more on the doable actions</p>
<p>Assumptions on what students cannot do:
1. move to a safer neighborhood (distance to school, finance)
2. </p>
<p>Not absolute vs ratio, but different interpretation</p>
<p>for pedestrian, </p>
